# Datastructures
## Basic
### Graph
a graph is a non-linear datastructure, consisting of multiple vertices and possibly directed;  
every vertex can be connected to others, by edges, these can be directional and or weighted.

### Hashmap
a hash-map is a linear datastructure, which reserves a predetermined space for storing references to data. 
every datapoint passes (partly) through a hash-function, taking the modulus of this hash, 
for finding a unique spot within the hash-map.

### Linked List
- Singly linked list
  - stack
- Doubly linked list
  - queue

## Combined
### hash-graph
combining a hash-map with a graph, allows for quick search-results, by searching on specific terms, 
a node can be returned, which in its turn can return its closest neighbours or another type of neighbour.
